- Monday 27 June 8 hours, start script edits, convert to typescript without breaking, multiple tests, artboard division breakthrough, separate new file into 2 artboards, core & expressive. Move masthead over to position artboard 3 with JS maths. Lots of reading old script and ai script docs. Drew diagram of intended funcitonalty and passed onto team for review.
