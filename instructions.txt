I haven't finished writing this yet!  
FULL README (unfinished): https://github.com/Artchibald/2022_icon_rebrand_scripts 
I can take this pop up out if you prefer. 
Video set up tutorial available here: XXXTBCXXX 
Open a .ai template provided in folders called test.
Go to file > Scripts > Other Scripts > Import our new script.
You must have the folder called images in the parent folder, this is where wtw_logo.ai is saved so it can be imported into the big purple banner and exported as assets.
Illustrator says (not responding) on PC but it will respond, give Bill Gates some time XD !) 
If you run the script again, you should probably delete the previous assets created. They get intermixed and overwritten. 
Both artboard sizes must be exactly 256px x 256px. 
Guides must be on a layer called exactly 'Guidelines'. 
Icons must be on a layer called exactly 'Art'. 
Make sure all icons are unlocked to avoid bugs. 
Exported assets will be saved where the .ai file is saved. 
Please try to use underscore instead of spaces to avoid bugs in filenames.
