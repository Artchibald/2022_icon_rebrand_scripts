- Illustrator says (not responding) on PC but it will respond, give Bill Gates some time XD !).
- If you run the script again, you should probably delete the previous assets created. They get intermixed and overwritten. 
- Both artboard sizes must be exactly 256px x 256px. 
- Guides must be on a layer called exactly 'Guidelines'. 
- Icons must be on a layer called exactly 'Art'. 
- Make sure all icons are unlocked to avoid bugs. 
- Exported assets will be saved where the .ai file is saved. 
- Please try to use underscore instead of spaces to avoid bugs in filenames.
