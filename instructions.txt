- This script only works locally not on a server.
- Don't forget to change .txt to .js on the script.

- Open your own .ai template or the provided ones in folders called test.
- Go to file > Scripts > Other Scripts > Import our new script.
- You must have the folder called images in the parent folder, this is where wtw_logo.ai is saved so it can be imported into the big purple banner and exported as assets. Otherwise you will get an error that says "error = svgFile".
- Illustrator says (not responding) on PC but it will respond, give Bill Gates some time XD !).
- If you run the script again, you should probably delete the previous assets created. They get intermixed and overwritten. 
- Both artboard sizes must be exactly 256px x 256px. 
- Guides must be on a layer called exactly 'Guidelines'. 
- Icons must be on a layer called exactly 'Art'. 
- Make sure all layers are unlocked to avoid bugs. 
- Exported assets will be saved where the .ai file is saved. 
- Please try to use underscore instead of spaces to avoid bugs in filenames. 
- Make sure you are using the correct swatches/colours. 
- Illustrator check advanced colour mode is correct:  Edit > Assign profile > Must match sRGB IEC61966-2.1.
- Select each individual color shape and under Window > Colours make sure each shape colour is set to rgb in tiny top right burger menu if bugs encountered.
- If it does not save exports as intended, check the file permissions of where the .ai file is saved (right click folder > Properties > Visibility > Read and write access? Also you can try "apply permissions to sub folders too" if you find that option)
